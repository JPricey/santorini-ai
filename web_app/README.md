# Getting Started

0. Install node (TODO: add steps for this)

1. From this directory, execute `npm run build:wasm`. This will build the wasm_app rust project, and output wasm artifacts into web_app/pkg.
2. Execute `npm start dev`. This will start the dev server.

## Deployment

Execute `npm run build`, to create the web_app/dist artifact. This can then be deployed
